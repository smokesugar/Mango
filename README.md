## Installation

You can clone the repository directly using your command line. Be sure to use `--recursive` so all dependencies are downloaded too.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/smokesugar/Mango
```
Because only DirectX is supported, Mango will only compile and run on windows. Run `GenerateProjects.bat` to generate project files.
